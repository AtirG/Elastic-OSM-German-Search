# Data Cleaning & Normalization

This directory contains domain-specific cleaning logic and documentation.

## Cleaning Domains

- [Cities](cities/README.md): Cleaning rules for city nodes.
- [Streets](streets/README.md): Cleaning rules for street ways.
- [Addresses](addresses/README.md): Cleaning rules for house/building addresses.

New domains should be added as subdirectories with their own `README.md` and cleaning scripts.
